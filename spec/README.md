# SpecKit Project Documentation

This project was developed using SpecKit methodology with specification-first development.

## Project Overview

AI Book Generator and RAG Chatbot system that creates comprehensive books using AI and allows users to interact with the content through a conversational interface powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

## SpecKit Artifacts

This directory contains the complete specification history for the project:

- **history.md**: Complete development history showing all prompts and decisions made during development
- **specs.md**: Technical specifications for all components and APIs
- **requirements.md**: Functional and non-functional requirements

## Development Process

The project followed a specification-first approach where all components were designed before implementation. Each development session was documented with the specific prompts used to guide the implementation.

## Components

1. **Book Generation Service**: Creates comprehensive AI-generated books
2. **Vector Storage System**: Stores content in Qdrant for semantic search
3. **RAG Engine**: Processes queries and generates contextual responses
4. **Web Interface**: Provides user-friendly access to the system
