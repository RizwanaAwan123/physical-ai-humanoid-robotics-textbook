## Chapter 2: Essential Mathematics for Robotics

This chapter provides a concise yet comprehensive review of the fundamental mathematical concepts that underpin the field of robotics. A strong grasp of these topics is crucial for understanding robot kinematics, dynamics, perception, and control. We will revisit key ideas from linear algebra, calculus, and probability, and introduce specialized mathematical tools such as quaternions for representing rotations. The emphasis will be on practical application, demonstrating how these mathematical principles are directly utilized in robotic systems. This chapter serves as a vital toolkit, equipping you with the necessary analytical skills to tackle the more advanced topics in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
