## Probability and Statistics: Uncertainty in Robotics

Uncertainty is inherent in robotic systems due to sensor noise, actuator errors, and environmental disturbances. Probability and statistics provide the mathematical framework for modeling and managing this uncertainty in robotics applications.

### Probability Fundamentals

**Random Variables**: Represent uncertain quantities in robotic systems, such as sensor measurements or state estimates.

**Probability Distributions**: Describe the likelihood of different outcomes. Common distributions in robotics include Gaussian (normal), uniform, and discrete distributions.

### Bayes' Rule

Bayes' rule forms the foundation of probabilistic inference in robotics:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

This is used extensively in sensor fusion, localization, and state estimation.

### Gaussian Distributions

Gaussian (normal) distributions are particularly important in robotics because:
- Many sensor errors are approximately Gaussian
- The Central Limit Theorem applies when combining multiple random variables
- They are mathematically tractable for inference algorithms

### State Estimation

Robotics often involves estimating unknown states (position, velocity, etc.) from noisy sensor data. This includes:
- Filtering: Estimating current state from past and current measurements
- Smoothing: Estimating past states from all available data
- Prediction: Estimating future states

### Applications in Robotics

- **Localization**: Estimating robot position in a known map
- **Mapping**: Building maps of unknown environments
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors
- **Kalman Filtering**: Optimal estimation for linear systems with Gaussian noise
- **Particle Filtering**: Estimation for non-linear, non-Gaussian systems
