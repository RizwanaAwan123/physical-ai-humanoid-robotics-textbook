## Introduction to Control Theory Mathematics

Control theory provides the mathematical foundation for making robotic systems behave in desired ways. Understanding the mathematical principles is essential for designing effective control systems for humanoid robots.

### System Modeling

**State-Space Representation**: Systems are represented by state variables that capture the system's behavior:

ẋ = f(x, u, t)
y = g(x, u, t)

Where x is the state vector, u is the input vector, and y is the output vector.

### Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems

For linear systems, the state-space model becomes:

ẋ = Ax + Bu
y = Cx + Du

Where A, B, C, and D are constant matrices.

### Classical Control Concepts

**Transfer Functions**: Represent the input-output relationship in the frequency domain using Laplace transforms.

**Stability**: A system is stable if bounded inputs produce bounded outputs. Stability analysis is crucial for safe robot operation.

**PID Control**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative control is fundamental in robotics:
- Proportional: Responds to current error
- Integral: Addresses accumulated past error
- Derivative: Predicts future error based on current rate of change

### Feedback Control

Feedback control uses measurements of the system's output to adjust the input, creating a closed-loop system that can reject disturbances and maintain desired performance.

### Control Design Considerations

**Performance**: How quickly and accurately the system responds to commands.

**Robustness**: Ability to maintain performance despite model uncertainties and disturbances.

**Stability Margins**: Quantitative measures of how close the system is to instability.

### Applications in Robotics

Control theory is applied throughout robotics for:
- Joint position and velocity control
- Balance and locomotion control
- Trajectory tracking
- Force control for manipulation tasks
