## 2.1 Linear Algebra: Vectors, Matrices, and Transformations

Linear algebra provides the foundational mathematical tools for representing spatial relationships, robot configurations, and transformations in robotics. Vectors are used to describe points in space or directions, while matrices are instrumental in representing rotations and translations.

### Vectors and Points

A vector $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ can represent a point in $n$-dimensional space or a displacement. In 3D robotics, we often deal with 3-element vectors.

```latex
\mathbf{p} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}
```

### Matrices and Transformations

Matrices are used for linear transformations, including scaling, shearing, and rotation. In robotics, a common tool is the Homogeneous Transformation Matrix (HTM) which combines rotation and translation into a single $4 \times 4$ matrix.

```latex
H = \begin{pmatrix}
    R & \mathbf{p} \\
    0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
```
Where $R$ is a $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix and $\mathbf{p}$ is a $3 \times 1$ translation vector.

### Example: 2D Rotation Matrix in Python

This Python code snippet demonstrates how to create a 2D rotation matrix and apply it to a point.

```python
import numpy as np

def rotate_2d(point, angle_deg):
    angle_rad = np.deg2rad(angle_deg)
    R = np.array([
        [np.cos(angle_rad), -np.sin(angle_rad)],
        [np.sin(angle_rad), np.cos(angle_rad)]
    ])
    return R @ point

# Example usage
point = np.array([1.0, 0.0]) # A point at (1,0)
rotated_point = rotate_2d(point, 90) # Rotate by 90 degrees
print(f"Original point: {point}")
print(f"Rotated point (90 deg): {rotated_point}")
```

```

### Multiple Choice Question

Which of the following matrices represents a pure translation in a homogeneous transformation matrix?

a) The $3 \times 3$ submatrix $R$

b) The $3 \times 1$ vector $\mathbf{p}$

c) The $1 \times 3$ vector of zeros

d) The scalar `1` in the bottom-right corner

**Answer:** b)

### Short Question

Explain why homogeneous transformation matrices are preferred over separate rotation and translation matrices in robotics.

### Assignment

Write a Python function that takes a 3D point and a translation vector as input and returns the translated point. Then, write another function that performs a rotation about the Z-axis using a $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix and applies it to a given 3D point. Combine these to apply a rotation then a translation.
