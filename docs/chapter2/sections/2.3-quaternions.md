## Quaternions and Rotation Representation

Quaternions provide a powerful and efficient method for representing rotations in 3D space. Unlike rotation matrices, quaternions avoid issues like gimbal lock and require fewer parameters to represent rotations.

### Introduction to Quaternions

A quaternion is a four-dimensional number that extends the concept of complex numbers. It consists of one real part and three imaginary parts:

q = w + xi + yj + zk

Where w is the scalar part and (x, y, z) form the vector part.

### Unit Quaternions for Rotation

For rotation representation, we use unit quaternions where the magnitude equals 1. A rotation by angle θ around a unit vector (x, y, z) is represented as:

q = [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) * x, sin(θ/2) * y, sin(θ/2) * z]

### Advantages of Quaternions

- **No Gimbal Lock**: Unlike Euler angles, quaternions don't suffer from gimbal lock
- **Efficient Interpolation**: Spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) provides smooth rotation interpolation
- **Compact Representation**: 4 parameters vs 9 for rotation matrices
- **Numerical Stability**: Less prone to numerical errors during concatenation of rotations

### Conversions

Quaternions can be converted to and from rotation matrices and Euler angles as needed for different applications.

### Applications in Robotics

Quaternions are widely used in robotics for representing joint orientations, end-effector poses, and for smooth interpolation between orientations in motion planning.
