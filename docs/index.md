# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook. This capstone curriculum is designed to provide students with comprehensive knowledge and practical skills in developing AI systems that interact with the physical world through humanoid robotic platforms.

This textbook follows a module-based approach that aligns with the 13-week academic quarter, progressing from foundational concepts in Physical AI to advanced implementations of conversational humanoid robots. Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a cohesive learning experience that combines theoretical understanding with hands-on implementation.

## Course Structure

The curriculum is organized into four core modules, each focusing on essential components of Physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

The course culminates in a comprehensive capstone project where students integrate all learned concepts to create an autonomous humanoid robot capable of receiving voice commands, planning tasks using large language models, navigating complex environments, and manipulating objects in simulation.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement robotic systems using the Robot Operating System (ROS 2)
- Create and utilize digital twins for robot simulation and testing
- Integrate AI systems with robotic platforms using NVIDIA Isaac technologies
- Develop vision-language-action systems for natural human-robot interaction
- Implement end-to-end autonomous humanoid robot systems
