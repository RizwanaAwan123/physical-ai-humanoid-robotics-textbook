## Chapter 3: Kinematics and Dynamics of Humanoid Robots

Upon completing this chapter, students will be able to:

*   **Formulate and solve forward and inverse kinematics problems** for humanoid arms and legs.
*   **Derive and interpret Jacobian matrices** for velocity analysis and control.
*   **Understand and apply Lagrangian and Newton-Euler methods** for robot dynamics.
*   **Analyze and ensure static and dynamic balance** using ZMP and centroidal dynamics.
*   **Implement basic kinematic and dynamic models** in Python.
