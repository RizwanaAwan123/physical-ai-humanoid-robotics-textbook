## Chapter 3: Kinematics and Dynamics of Humanoid Robots

This chapter delves into the fundamental mechanics that govern the movement of humanoid robots. We will meticulously explore kinematics, the study of robot motion without considering the forces causing it, covering topics such as rigid body transformations, forward kinematics (determining end-effector position from joint angles), and inverse kinematics (calculating joint angles for a desired end-effector pose). Furthermore, we will introduce differential kinematics to analyze velocities and Jacobians. Subsequently, we will transition to dynamics, which incorporates forces and torques to understand how robots move under various conditions. A crucial aspect of humanoid robotics, balance and stability, will be examined through concepts like the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and centroidal dynamics. A solid understanding of these principles is essential for designing, controlling, and simulating realistic and stable humanoid behaviors.
