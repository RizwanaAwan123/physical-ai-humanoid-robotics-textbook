## Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

This introductory chapter sets the stage for our exploration into the fascinating and rapidly evolving world where artificial intelligence meets physical embodiment. We will define what constitutes 'Physical AI' and how it differs from traditional, disembodied AI systems. Tracing the historical trajectory of robotics, we will observe the gradual shift towards more human-like machines and understand the motivations behind developing humanoid robots.

We will also take a preliminary look at the essential components that make up a humanoid robot, from its actuators to its sensors and computational core. Crucially, this chapter will initiate a discussion on the profound ethical, societal, and economic implications that arise with the integration of intelligent humanoids into our daily lives. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid foundational understanding of the field and be prepared to delve into its deeper scientific and engineering complexities.
