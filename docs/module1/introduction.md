# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) serves as the fundamental communication infrastructure for robotic systems, functioning analogously to a biological nervous system. Just as the nervous system enables coordinated communication between different parts of an organism, ROS 2 provides the essential middleware that connects sensors, actuators, controllers, and artificial intelligence components within a robotic platform.

This module establishes the foundational understanding of ROS 2 architecture and its critical role in Physical AI systems. Students will learn how ROS 2 enables the distributed processing necessary for real-time robotic operation, facilitates the integration of diverse hardware components, and provides the communication patterns essential for complex robotic behaviors.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Explain the architectural principles of ROS 2 and its role as a robotic communication middleware
- Implement nodes, topics, services, and actions for robotic communication
- Develop Python-based robotic controllers using the rclpy library
- Integrate AI agents with ROS 2 controllers for intelligent robotic behavior
- Create and utilize URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files for humanoid robots

## Module Structure

This module is structured to progress from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced integration with Physical AI systems:

1. **ROS 2 Foundations**: Understanding the core concepts and architecture of ROS 2
2. **Communication Patterns**: Mastering nodes, topics, services, and actions
3. **Python Control**: Implementing robotic controllers using rclpy
4. **AI Integration**: Connecting AI agents to ROS 2 control systems
5. **URDF for Humanoids**: Creating robot descriptions for humanoid platforms

## Prerequisites

Students should have:

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with Linux command line operations
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts
- Knowledge of fundamental programming patterns

## Assessment

Module assessment includes practical implementation of ROS 2 nodes that demonstrate understanding of communication patterns, integration of AI decision-making with robotic control, and creation of humanoid robot descriptions using URDF.
