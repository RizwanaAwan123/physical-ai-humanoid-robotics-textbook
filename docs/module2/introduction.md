# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

The concept of a digital twin represents a virtual replica of a physical system that enables comprehensive testing, validation, and optimization before deployment in the real world. In the context of Physical AI and humanoid robotics, digital twins serve as essential environments where AI systems can be trained, tested, and validated in physics-accurate simulations that mirror real-world conditions.

This module explores the creation and utilization of digital twins using two primary simulation platforms: Gazebo for physics-based simulation and Unity for advanced visualization and human-robot interaction. Students will learn to develop comprehensive virtual environments that accurately model the physical properties, dynamics, and interactions of humanoid robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Design and implement physics-accurate simulation environments using Gazebo
- Create advanced visualization and interaction systems using Unity
- Integrate sensor simulation for realistic perception in virtual environments
- Develop digital twins that accurately represent physical humanoid robots
- Implement human-robot interaction scenarios in virtual environments
