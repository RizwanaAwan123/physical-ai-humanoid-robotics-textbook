## Chapter 5: Actuation and Mechanical Design

This chapter transitions from the abstract mathematical and perceptual aspects to the tangible physical realization of humanoid robots. We will explore the critical engineering considerations involved in designing and selecting the components that enable a robot to move, exert force, and withstand the rigors of physical interaction. The focus will be on **actuation systems**, the 'muscles' that drive robot joints, covering various motor types, hydraulic and pneumatic systems, and the increasingly important concept of compliant actuation. Alongside actuators, we will delve into the **mechanical design** of the robot's structure, including material selection, gearbox mechanisms, and the crucial aspects of thermal management and power distribution. A deep understanding of these topics is essential for building robust, efficient, and capable humanoid robots that can safely and effectively operate in the real world.
