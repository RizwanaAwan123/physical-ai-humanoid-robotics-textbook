## Hydraulic and Pneumatic Actuation Systems

Hydraulic and pneumatic actuation systems provide alternative approaches to electric motors for generating motion and force in robotic systems. While less common in humanoid robots than electric motors, they offer unique advantages in certain applications.

### Hydraulic Actuation

**Hydraulic systems** use pressurized fluid (typically oil) to generate force and motion. They are capable of producing very high forces and torques relative to their size, making them suitable for applications requiring significant power density.

**Advantages**:
- High power-to-weight ratio
- Precise force control
- Fast response times
- Ability to hold position under load without consuming energy

**Disadvantages**:
- Complexity of fluid management (pumps, reservoirs, valves)
- Potential for fluid leaks
- Maintenance requirements
- Weight of hydraulic components
- Noise generation

### Pneumatic Actuation

**Pneumatic systems** use compressed air to generate motion. They are generally lighter than hydraulic systems and can provide rapid, responsive actuation.

**Advantages**:
- Fast response times
- Clean operation (no fluid contamination risk)
- Lower maintenance than hydraulic systems
- Inherently compliant behavior
- Lower cost components

**Disadvantages**:
- Lower force density compared to hydraulics
- Compressibility of air affects precision
- Requires compressed air supply or compressor
- Energy inefficiency due to air compression
- Noise from air exhaust

### Applications in Humanoid Robotics

Hydraulic and pneumatic systems have been used in some humanoid robots, particularly those designed for high-force applications or where their specific characteristics are advantageous. However, electric motors remain more common due to their simplicity, controllability, and integration advantages.

### Hybrid Systems

Some advanced humanoid robots employ hybrid actuation systems that combine different technologies. For example, electric motors might be used for precision positioning while hydraulic or pneumatic systems provide high-force capabilities for specific tasks.
