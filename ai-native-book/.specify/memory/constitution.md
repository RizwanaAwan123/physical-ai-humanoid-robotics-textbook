# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Comprehensive & Self-Contained Chapters
Each chapter must be a complete, standalone unit, covering its topic thoroughly without requiring external references to understand core concepts. All necessary context, explanations, and examples are to be provided within the chapter.

### II. Clarity for AI Students
Content must be written with a clear, concise, and accessible style, specifically tailored for AI students. Complex topics should be broken down into understandable segments, using straightforward language.

### III. Rich Learning Media
Chapters must integrate a variety of learning media, including well-documented code snippets, illustrative diagrams, and informative tables, to enhance comprehension and engagement.

### IV. Practical Application & Assessment
Each chapter must include practical exercises or thought-provoking questions to reinforce learning, encourage critical thinking, and allow students to apply concepts.

### V. Structured & Detailed Outlines
The book will feature a detailed Table of Contents and comprehensive chapter outlines, each with 5-7 subtopics, ensuring a logical flow and deep coverage of subjects.
