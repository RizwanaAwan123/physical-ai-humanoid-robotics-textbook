# Clarify


parameters:
  modules:
    - Learning: ROS 2 coding, AI concepts
    - Simulation: Gazebo/Unity simulations
    - AI Training: NVIDIA Isaac perception & VLA models
    - Capstone: Autonomous humanoid project
  output_format:
    - Table with columns: task_name, module, description, priority
notes:
  - Classify tasks based on learning, simulation, AI training, capstone
  - Highlight cloud vs edge deployment tasks

goal: "Ensure all course concepts and hardware/software requirements are clearly defined"
  items_to_clarify:
    - ROS 2 nodes, topics, services
    - Gazebo/Unity simulations
    - NVIDIA Isaac Sim & ROS integration
    - VLA (Voice-Language-Action) modules
    - Edge AI hardware: Jetson, RealSense, microphones
    - Optional physical robots: Unitree Go2/G1
  output_format:
    - List of clarifications with simple explanations
notes:
  - Include dependencies between modules
  - Include minimum vs ideal hardware specifications
